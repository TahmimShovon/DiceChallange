# DiceChallange

This is a simple project to show Document Object Manipulation (DOM) skills.
It is a fun website where two players compete depending on the outcome of random dice number.
HTML and CSS have been used here for the structure and designing of this project and basic javascript is used here for DOM.
This app can be used to come to a conclusion in a head or tail type situation where you need to toss your luck.
Feel free to use any files used here for your work purpose or assignment purpose.
